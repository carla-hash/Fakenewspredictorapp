    st.write('''
        Welcome to the murky world of fake news, where facts are distorted and
        the truth is often just a disguise. In an age where misinformation
        spreads faster than ever, knowing what is true and what is not has
        become a daily challenge. Fake news is designed to manipulate, shared to
        divide, and intended to deceive, shock, and influence. By eroding trust
        in the media, damaging reputations, and fueling confusion or fear, it
        undermines the very foundations of our society.
